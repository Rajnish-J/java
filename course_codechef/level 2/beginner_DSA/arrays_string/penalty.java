//Using your current knowledge of arrays - you can solve the following problem!
//Task
//It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shootouts.
// * Each team is given 5 shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game.
// *If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have 2 champions.

//Given ten integers A1 to A10, determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.
// *the odd indexed integers represent the outcome of the shots made by team 1
// *the even indexed integers represent the outcome of the shots made by team 2

//Note that here Ai = 1 indicates that it's a goal and Ai =0 indicates a miss.
