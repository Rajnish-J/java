//Each contest - there are approximately 1500 - 2000 users who participate for the 1st time and get rated.
//The Chef wanted to tell new users some tricks for their 1st contest:
// * Before the contest - you don’t have any rating. So even if you make a single submission, 
//you will become part of the contest rank list and you will get a rating.
// * If you want your rating to increase - give the entire 2 hours to the contest & don’t quit! If you keep trying till the end, 
//and the more time you get, the more problems you can solve. That means larger rating increases!
// * Do not ask your friends for their code. If you copy paste their code, you will get caught during plagiarism checks 
//and your rating will be reduced by 275 points, along with a permanent black mark on your profile.
