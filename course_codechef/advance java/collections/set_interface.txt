Set Interface

What is a Set Interface?

Well, it's basically a collection of unique elements, meaning that each element in the set is different from the others. 
Think of it like a group of friends - each friend is unique and has their own personality and characteristics, just like each element in a set is unique.

There are several Set Interface classes in Java, including HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. Each of these classes has its own unique characteristics and advantages.

HashSet is the most commonly used Set Interface class. It's implemented using a hash table, which means that elements are stored in an array and accessed using a hash code. 
This makes HashSet very fast for adding, removing, and checking the presence of elements.

TreeSet is another Set Interface class that's implemented using a tree data structure. It's useful when you need to maintain elements in sorted order, which can be helpful for some applications.

LinkedHashSet is similar to HashSet, but it also maintains the order in which elements were added to the set. This can be useful if you need to iterate through the elements in a specific order.
