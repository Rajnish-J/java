Iterators

An iterator is an object that allows you to loop through a collection and access each element one at a time. 
It's like having a little pointer that moves through the collection, keeping track of where you are and what you've already seen.

Did you know that there are actually several different types of iterators? Each one has its own unique features and use cases.

Let's take a look at some of the most common types of iterators:

Iterator: This is the most basic type of iterator that we've already discussed. It allows us to loop through a collection and access each element one at a time.

ListIterator: This type of iterator is used specifically for lists (like ArrayLists). 
              It allows us to loop through the list in both directions (forward and backward) and also lets us modify the list while we're looping through it.
