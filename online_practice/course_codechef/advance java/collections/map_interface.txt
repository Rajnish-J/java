Introduction to Map Interface

Imagine you have a big treasure chest filled with all sorts of valuable items, like gold coins, diamonds, and rubies. You want to keep track of each item and its corresponding value, so you don't lose anything. 
This is where the Map interface comes in!

The Map interface is like a treasure map that allows you to store and access data using a key-value system. 
Each item is assigned a unique key, like a number or a string, and its corresponding value can be anything, like an integer or a string. 
This means you can easily find any item in the treasure chest by looking up its key.

But wait, there's more! The Map interface also allows you to easily add, remove, and modify items in the treasure chest without losing any other items. 
You can even check if a certain key already exists in the treasure map, so you don't accidentally overwrite any valuable items.

So, in short, the Map interface is like a treasure map that allows you to store and access data using a key-value system, making it easy to find and modify any item in the treasure chest.

HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap are the classes in Map Interface.

Happy mapping!
