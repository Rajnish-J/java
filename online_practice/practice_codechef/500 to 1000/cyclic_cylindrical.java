Cyclic Quadrilateral
Read problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given the sizes of angles of a simple quadrilateral (in degrees) A, B, C and D, in some order along its perimeter. Determine whether the quadrilateral is cyclic.

Note: A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of opposite angles is 180âˆ˜.
