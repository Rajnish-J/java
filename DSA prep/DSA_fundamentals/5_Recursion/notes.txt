Recursion: 
    Function calling itself
    usage: solve a problem, find the solution for a sub problem and use that to solve your actual program.

    Example: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 (sum of N elements)

    sum(4) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
           = sum(3) + 4
           sum(N) = sum(N-1) + N

workflow / creation / idealogy:
    1) assumption: 
        Decide what your function should do, assume it does
    2) main logic: 
        solving problems with subproblems
    3) base case: 
        when code stops
