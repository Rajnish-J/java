// chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym. 
// The monthly cost of the gym is X and personal training will cost him an additional Y per month. Chef's total budget per month is only Z. 
// Print 1 if Chef can only join the gym, 2 if he can also have a personal trainer, and 0 if he can't even join the gym.

// Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer, he must join the gym â€” he cannot hire the trainer without joining the gym.
