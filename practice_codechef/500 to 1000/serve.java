// It is My Serve

// Alice and Bob are playing a game of table tennis where irrespective of the point scored, every player makes 2 consecutive serves before the service changes. 
// Alice makes the first serve of the match. Therefore the first 2 serves will be made by Alice, then the next 2 serves will be made by Bob and so on.

// Let's consider the following example match for more clarity:
// * Alice makes the 1st serve.
// * Let us assume, Bob wins this point. (Score is 0 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
// * Alice makes the 2nd serve.
// * Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 1 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
// * Bob makes the 3rd serve.
// * Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 2 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
// * Bob makes the 4th serve.
// * Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 3 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
// * Alice makes the 5th serve.
// * And the game continues â€¦

// After the score reaches P and Q for Alice and Bob respectively, both the players forgot whose serve it is. Help them determine whose service it is.
